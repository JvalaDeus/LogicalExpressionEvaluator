# LogicalExpressionEvaluator
This my final project for AP CS semester one. This project is a logic based one, and is supposed to evaluate an expression for all the 
different combinations of true/false values on the truth table. Then it is supposed to determinewhether or not the expression is valid, 
satisfiable, and/or contingent. Next it is to take a second expression and test if the two are equivalent and if the first expression 
entails the second. From what I know, this project does fufill all the requirements of the project. The only thing I wish I did was make 
it so you could input the two expressions through buffered reader, with an arbitrary  amount of variables. Right now if you want to add 
more variables you must add a do, then variable = !variable, then while(variable). I might work on this over break to make it so you can 
easily choose the amount of variables you want. The challenge was simply getting started for me, I did not really know how to do the 
truth table and set the values because I was hung up on inputting the expression yourself. However, once I gave up on that (Sadly. Plus 
thats probably what we were supposed to do), I finished the rest really quickly (making me wonder what I messed up!). I would like to 
mention that I got the truth table code from: http://www.javaforstudents.co.uk/TrueFalse. I did add more loops and stuff to the truth 
table, but that is where I got the majority of the method from. I would like to thank Mr. Kuszmaul for giving me an extension on this 
project due to my illnesses & migranes.
